### 1. What is the Midjourney Prompt Library Site?

This site collects and categorically displays high-quality Midjourney prompts from Twitter, Xiaohongshu, and WeChat.

### 2. Why did I build this site?

I built this site for two main reasons:
- As a hobby, while trying to generate WeChat red packet covers using Midjourney, I discovered that writing good prompts is quite challenging for beginners and has a learning curve. High-quality prompts shared by others can help quickly generate desired images and serve as learning materials. 
This site serves both as a directory site and a resource library.
- For personal interest, if the site generates decent traffic, I plan to apply for Google AdSense to see if I can earn my first dollars.
